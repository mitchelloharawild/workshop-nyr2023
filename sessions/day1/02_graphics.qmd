## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 3

1. Look at the quarterly tourism data for the Snowy Mountains

    ```r
    snowy <- tourism |> filter(Region == "Snowy Mountains")
    ```

    - Use `autoplot()`, `gg_season()` and `gg_subseries()` to explore the data.
    - What do you learn?

2. Produce a calendar plot for the `pedestrian` data from one location and one year.

### Lab Session 4

We have introduced the following functions: `gg_lag` and `ACF`. Use these functions to explore the four time series: `Bricks` from `aus_production`, `Lynx` from `pelt`, `Close` price of Amazon from `gafa_stock`, `Demand` from `vic_elec`. Can you spot any seasonality, cyclicity and trend? What do you learn about the series?

### Lab Session 5

You can compute the daily changes in the Google stock price in 2018 using

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dgoog <- gafa_stock |>
  filter(Symbol == "GOOG", year(Date) >= 2018) |>
  mutate(trading_day = row_number()) |>
  update_tsibble(index=trading_day, regular=TRUE) |>
  mutate(diff = difference(Close))
```

Does `diff` look like white noise?
