## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 9

 * Use ``GGally::ggpairs()`` to look at the relationships between the STL-based features. You might wish to change `seasonal_peak_year` and `seasonal_trough_year` to factors.
 * Which is the peak quarter for holidays in each state?

### Lab Session 10

* Use a feature-based approach to look for outlying series in `PBS`.
* What is unusual about the series you identify as "outliers".
