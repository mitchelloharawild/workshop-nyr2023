## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 8

1. Produce the following decomposition

    ```r
    canadian_gas |>
      STL(Volume ~ season(window=7) + trend(window=11)) |>
      autoplot()
    ```

2. What happens as you change the values of the two `window` arguments?

3. How does the seasonal shape change over time? [Hint: Try plotting the seasonal component using `gg_season`.]

4. Can you produce a plausible seasonally adjusted series? [Hint: `season_adjust` is one of the variables returned by `STL`.]
