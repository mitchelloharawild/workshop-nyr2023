## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 20

* Prepare aggregations of the PBS data by Concession, Type, and ATC1.
* Use forecast reconciliation with the PBS data, using ETS, ARIMA and SNAIVE models, applied to all but the last 3 years of data.
* Which type of model works best?
* Does the reconciliation improve the forecast accuracy?
* Why doesn't the reconciliation make any difference to the SNAIVE forecasts?
