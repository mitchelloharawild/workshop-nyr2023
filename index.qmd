## Course Overview

It is common for organizations to collect huge amounts of data over time, and existing time series analysis tools are not always suitable to handle the scale, frequency and structure of the data collected. In this workshop, we will look at some packages and methods that have been developed to handle the analysis of large collections of time series.

On day 1, we will look at the tsibble data structure for flexibly managing collections of related time series. We will look at how to do data wrangling, data visualizations and exploratory data analysis. We will explore feature-based methods to explore time series data in high dimensions. A similar feature-based approach can be used to identify anomalous time series within a collection of time series, or to cluster or classify time series. Primary packages for day 1 will be [tsibble](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble), [lubridate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lubridate) and [feasts](https://cran.r-project.org/package=feasts) (along with the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org) of course).

Day 2 will be about forecasting. We will look at some classical time series models and how they are automated in the [fable](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fable) package. We will look at creating ensemble forecasts and hybrid forecasts, as well as some new forecasting methods that have performed well in large-scale forecasting competitions. Finally, we will look at forecast reconciliation, allowing millions of time series to be forecast in a relatively short time while accounting for constraints on how the series are related.

This workshop is part of the [NYR 2023](https://rstats.ai/nyr/) event, and will run in-person at [Columbia University](Columbia University) on the 11-12th July 2023.

## Learning objectives

Attendees will learn:

1. How to wrangle time series data with familiar tidy tools.
2. How to compute time series features and visualize large collections of time series.
3. How to select a good forecasting algorithm for your time series.
4. How to ensure forecasts of a large collection of time series are coherent.

# Registration

Registration is available at <https://rstats.ai/nyr>.

Tickets to the workshop are sold separately from the conference.

# Preparation

The workshop will provide a quick-start overview of exploring time series data and producing forecasts. There is no need for prior experience in time series to get the most out of this workshop.

It is expected that you are comfortable with writing R cod and using tidyverse packages including dplyr and ggplot2. If you are unfamiliar with writing R code or using the tidyverse, consider working through the learnr materials here: <https://learnr.numbat.space/>.

Some familiarity with statistical concepts such as the mean, variance, quantiles, normal distribution, and regression would be helpful to better understand the forecasts, although this is not strictly necessary.

## Required equipment

Please bring your own laptop capable of running R.

## Required software

To be able to complete the exercises of this workshop, please install a suitable IDE (such as RStudio), a recent version of R (4.1+) and the following packages.

-   **Time series packages and extensions**
